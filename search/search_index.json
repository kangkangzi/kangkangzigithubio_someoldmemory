The main reason I build this site is that MkDocs is a good way to store notes. Another reason is for fun! I'm sure that learning somethings like theoretical computer science will not help me get a job in China at all. But it's fun! That's enough. What I will upload on this site? Books: After reading a book I will post my reviews here. I will mark down big ideas I learned form the book. Other readers can decide whether to read it or not. Courses: I will take some course which open their materials on the internet, finish the discussion,homework, lab and project. But I will not open the code directly on the internet. Papers: I will post some papers here for further studying. I think reading and reimplementing papers is important if I want to become a computer scientist like Von Neumann, Turing or Dijkstra.","title":"Q&A"},{"location":"q%26a/#qa","text":"","title":"Q&amp;A"},{"location":"q%26a/#why-i-build-this-site","text":"The main reason I build this site is that MkDocs is a good way to store notes.

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs(SICP), is a computer science textbook by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professors Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman. It teaches fundamental principles of computer programming, including recursion, abstraction, modularity, and programming language design and implementation. MIT Press published the JavaScript edition in 2022, and I choose this edition. Why I read this books? Just for fun! I picked up this books at 2022 summer. After reading few pages I was shocked completely. Fourier series, Simpson's rule, fast exponentiation, lambda calculus and other interesting concepts are combined in such thin a book.","title":"intro"},{"location":"books/sicp/intro/#intro","text":"","title":"Intro"},{"location":"books/sicp/intro/#what-is-sicp","text":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs(SICP), is a computer science textbook by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professors Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman.
